The Public Whip Source Code
---------------------------

Hello!  Here's the source code behind the Public Whip website.  To see the end
product go to http://www.publicwhip.org.uk.  If you don't know what this is all
about, have a look at the FAQ there.  

The code is currently under a major rewrite at the moment and so things may change quite quickly.

To learn how to use the code look at http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/project/code.php 
or locally in webpage/project/code.php.  You should also check out the
Parliament Parse project at http://ukparse.kforge.net/parlparse, which is the
scraper that made the data Public Whip uses.
